# Clocks Functional Requirements

    To meet international standard ISO 8601,
    view of the clock should be in 12-
    and a 24-hour clock rather than just the standard 12-hour clock.

## Functional Requirements:
   - Clock12: Time should be displayed in 12-hour format where the clock does not exceed 12:59:59.
   - Clock24: Time should be displayed in 24-hour format where the clock does not exceed 23:59:59.
   - Both clocks should display on the screen with the current time in the proper format.
